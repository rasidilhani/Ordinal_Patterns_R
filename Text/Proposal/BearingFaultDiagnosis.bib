Abstract = {Pattern classification is one of the major methodologies used for fault
   diagnosis. Employing trend modeling technique, such as nonlinear signal
   processing tools, to construct new pattern classification method often
   provides unique advantage for detecting and recognizing faults. In this
   paper, a novel supervised pattern classification algorithm applied to
   fault diagnosis is proposed on the basis of one-dimensional adaptive
   rank-order morphological filter (1DARMF). The algorithm adopts 1DARMF to
   process noised signal under supervision of each reference signal and
   compares output signal against corresponding reference one to find out
   which pairs match each other the best. Based on the procedures, it
   manages to recognize different noised signals. Parameters of the
   proposed algorithm are subject to random choice and adaptively tuned,
   which makes the algorithm readily be adopted in many applications.
   Important implementing issues such as enhancement of correct
   classification rate and the trade-off balance between algorithm
   convergence rate and computational cost are also discussed in details.

   advantages of proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Shannon wavelet spectrum analysis on truncated vibration signals for

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although a variety of methods have been proposed in the literature for
   machine fault detection, it still remains a challenge to extract
   prominent features from random and nonstationary vibratory signals, a
   typical representative of which are the resonance signatures generated
   by incipient defects on the rolling elements of ball bearings. Due to
   its random and nonstationary nature, the involved signal generally
   possesses a low signal-to-noise ratio, where the classical signal
   processing methods cannot be effectively applied and the extracted
   features are usually submerged into the severe background noise. In this
   paper, a novel random and nonstationary vibratory signature analysis
   (R\&N-VSA) technique is presented to address this challenge. The
   original vibration signal is decomposed into fault-related and
   non-fault-related signal segments, and multi-level exponential moving
   average power filtering is suggested to guide this decomposition.
   Instead of analyzing the whole vibratory signal, the developed Shannon
   wavelet spectrum analysis is more efficiently applied on the truncated
   fault-related signal segments so as to enhance the features'
   characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is examined
   through a series of tests with two experimental setups, and the
   investigation results show that the developed R\&N-VSA technique is an
   effective signal processing technique for incipient machine fault
   detection.},

Abstract = {Sparse signal models with learned dictionaries of morphological features
   provide efficient codes in a variety of applications. Such models can be
   useful to reduce sensor data rates and simplify the communication,
   processing and analysis of information, provided that the algorithm can
   be realized in an efficient way and that the signal allows for sparse
   coding. In this paper we outline an FPGA prototype of a general purpose
   ``analog-to-feature converter{''}, which learns an overcomplete
   dictionary of features from the input signal using matching pursuit and
   a form of Hebbian learning. The resulting code is sparse, event-based
   and suitable for analysis with parallel and neuromorphic processors. We
   present results of two case studies. The first case is a blind source
   separation problem where features are learned from an artificial signal
   with known features. We demonstrate that the learned features are
   qualitatively consistent with the true features. In the second case,
   features are learned from ball-bearing vibration data. We find that
   vibration signals from bearings with faults have characteristic features
   and codes, and that the event-based code enable a reduction of the data
   rate by at least one order of magnitude.},

Abstract = {Condition monitoring schemes, able to deal with different sources of
   fault are, nowadays, required by the industrial sector to improve their
   manufacturing control systems. Pattern recognition approaches, allow the
   identification of multiple system's scenarios by means the relations
   between numerical features. The numerical features are calculated from
   acquired physical magnitudes, in order to characterize its behavior.
   However, only a reduced set of numerical features are used in order to
   avoid computational performance limitations of the artificial
   intelligence techniques. In this sense, feature reduction techniques are
   applied. Classical approaches analyze the features significance from a
   global data discrimination point of view. This paper, however, proposes
   a novel and reliable methodology to exploit the information contained in
   the original features set, by means a dedicated hierarchy of neural
   networks.},

Abstract = {Vibration data of faulty rolling bearings, are usually nonstationary and
   nonlinear, and contain fairly weak fault features. As a result, feature
   extraction of rolling bearing fault data is always an intractable
   problem and has attracted considerable attention for a long time. This
   paper introduces multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) to
   analyze bearing vibration data and proposes a novel method for fault
   diagnosis of rolling bearings based on MF-DFA and Mahalanobis distance
   criterion (MDC). MF-DFA, an extension of monofractal DFA, is a powerful
   tool for uncovering the nonlinear dynamical characteristics buried in
   nonstationary time series and can capture minor changes of complex
   system conditions. To begin with, by MF-DFA, multifractality of bearing
   fault. data was quantified with the generalized Hurst exponent, the
   scaling exponent and the multifractal spectrum. Consequently, controlled
   by essentially different dynamical mechanisms, the multifractality of
   four heterogeneous bearing fault data is significantly different; by
   contrast, controlled by slightly different dynamical mechanisms, the
   multifractality of homogeneous bearing fault data with different fault
   diameters is significantly or slightly different depending on different
   types of bearing faults. Therefore, the multifractal spectrum, as a set
   of parameters describing multifractality of time series, can be employed
   to characterize different types and severity of bearing faults.
   Subsequently, five characteristic parameters sensitive to changes of
   bearing fault conditions were extracted from the multifractal spectrum
   and utilized to construct fault features of bearing fault data.
   Moreover, Hilbert transform based envelope analysis, empirical mode
   decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform (WT) were utilized to study
   the same bearing fault data. Also, the kurtosis and the peak levels of
   the EMD or the WT component corresponding to the bearing tones in the
   frequency domain were carefully checked and used as the bearing fault
   features. Next, MDC was used to classify the bearing fault features
   extracted by EMD, WT and MF-DFA in the time domain and assess the
   abilities of the three methods to extract fault features from bearing
   fault data. The results show that MF-DFA seems to outperform each of
   envelope analysis, statistical parameters, EMD and WT in feature
   extraction of bearing fault data and then the proposed method in this
   paper delivers satisfactory performances in distinguishing different
   types and severity of bearing faults. Furthermore, to further ascertain
   the nature causing the multifractality of bearing vibration data, the
   generalized Hurst exponents of the original bearing vibration data were
   compared with those of the shuffled and the surrogated data.
   Consequently, the long-range correlations for small and large
   fluctuations of data seem to be chiefly responsible for the
   multifractality of bearing vibration data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {A new fault diagnosis method for rolling element bearing is proposed
   based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and fisher discriminant
   analysis (FDA). First, non-stationary vibration signals are processed by
   applying EMD technique, and stationary IMF components are obtained.
   Then, fault feature vectors with the moving time-lagged windows are
   composed using the absolute values of IMF components of healthy and
   detection bearings in order to consider the dynamic behavior. Finally, a
   DFDA model is construed and a linear discriminant matrix is obtained by
   which IMF components are projected into the low discriminant space. The
   diagnosis performance of the proposed method is tested using a dataset
   from bearing data center of Case Western Reserve University.},

   Morphological Analysis and Its Application in Rolling Element Bearing
   Fault Diagnosis},
Journal = {SHOCK AND VIBRATION},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {2014},
Abstract = {Mathematical morphology (MM) is an efficient nonlinear signal processing
   tool. It can be adopted to extract fault information from bearing signal
   according to a structuring element (SE). Since the bearing signal
   features differ for every unique cause of failure, the SEs should be
   well tailored to extract the fault feature from a particular signal. In
   the following, a signal based triangular SE according to the statistics
   of the magnitude of a vibration signal is proposed, together with
   associated methodology, which processes the bearing signal by MM
   analysis based on proposed SE to get the morphology spectrum of a
   signal. A correlation analysis on morphology spectrum is then employed
   to obtain the final classification of bearing faults. The classification
   performance of the proposed method is evaluated by a set of bearing
   vibration signals with inner race, ball, and outer race faults,
   respectively. Results show that all faults can be detected clearly and
   correctly. Compared with a commonly used flat SE, the correlation
   analysis on morphology spectrum with proposed SE gives better
   performance at fault diagnosis of bearing, especially the identification
   of the location of outer race fault and the level of fault severity.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a composited method named as CEEMD-EMD
   (complementary EEMD and EMD) to analyze rolling bearings' defective
   signals. Through CEEMD-EMD method, some interested intrinsic mode
   functions (IMFs) were collected, and then calculated envelope spectrum
   was used to identify the defects in the rolling bearings. The advantages
   of CEEMD-EMD method over EMD and CEEMD methods were obtained by
   simulation estimation. The calculation showed CEEMD-EMD method not only
   overcomes the disadvantage of mode mixing problem, but also removes
   residual noise and solves mode splitting problem. Then CEEMD-EMD
   approach was used to analyze vibration signals of rolling bearings. The
   analysis results demonstrated CEEMD-EMD approach combined with envelope
   spectrum analysis is an ideal and valid way to extract fault features in
   the testing signals of rolling bearings.},

Abstract = {The general method for bearing fault detection is achieved by using
   bearing vibration signals which sampled in the frame of Shannon sampling
   theory. So it is necessary to sample and save abundant original
   vibration data in the process of uninterrupted monitoring, and this will
   generate masses of original data which would burden the storage and
   transmission. For this issue, a fault detection method based on
   compressed sensing theory is proposed in this paper. It only needs to
   sample and save fewer compressive measurements of bearing vibration
   signal directly compared to original signal. There is no need to recover
   the original signal accurately for detecting bearing faults, while it
   just requires referring to the prior training result and reconstructing
   the overall energy distribution of the original signal in some transform
   domain. The availability and effectiveness of the method proposed is
   validated with bearing vibration signals sampled in practice.},

Title = {A novel method for feature extraction using crossover characteristics of
   nonlinear data and its application to fault diagnosis of rotary

Abstract = {Defective rotary machinery typically exhibits a complex dynamical
   behavior, which is hard to analyze. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
   is a robust tool for uncovering long-range correlations hidden in
   nonstationary data. By DFA, an original series can be compressed into a
   fluctuation series, which can well preserve the dynamical
   characteristics of the original series. Lately, the fluctuation series
   has been separately analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and
   neural network (NN) for fault diagnosis of rotary machinery. However,
   the feature parameters extracted by PCA or NN normally lack clear
   physical meaning. In addition, the execution of PCA or NN usually
   consumes extra time. Interestingly, the scaling-law curve, by which the
   relation between the fluctuation function and the time scale can be
   illustrated graphically in a log-log plot, usually exhibits crossover
   properties. As a result, this study exploited the interesting crossover
   properties for fault diagnosis of rotary machinery and proposed a novel
   method for feature extraction of nonlinear data. The proposed method
   consists of three parts. Firstly, the vibration data from defective
   rotary machinery are analyzed by DFA and the resultant scaling-law curve
   is obtained. Secondly, the crossover points in the scaling-law curve are
   located and then employed to segment the entire scaling-law curve into
   several different scaling regions, in each of which a single Hurst
   exponent can be estimated. Thirdly, the whole or a part of the Hurst
   exponents are used as feature parameters for describing the conditions
   of defective rotary machinery. Next, the performance of the proposed
   method was measured using both real gearbox and rolling bearing
   vibration data with different fault types and severity. The results
   indicate that the proposed method can ease the problems mentioned
   previously and performs well in identifying fault types and severity of
   rotary machinery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for fault
   diagnostics is proposed. The method is tested with an artificial case
   study representing three start-up faulty behaviors of equipment and
   then, applied for diagnosing faults in motor bearings: the data have
   been collected from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center
   with three failure modes. The method has been tested and compared to the
   K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method. The obtained results show that the SOM
   algorithm is a powerful visualization tool able to recognize the fault
   classes with a low misclassification rate. Furthermore, the quality of
   the SOM has been assessed using two measures: average quantization error
   and topographic error and their sensitivity with respect to the map size
   is investigated.},

Abstract = {The nonlocal means (NIL-Means) method that has been widely used in the
   field of image processing in recent years effectively overcomes the
   limitations of the neighborhood filter and eliminates the artifact and
   edge problems caused by the traditional image denoising methods.
   Although NIL-Means is very popular in the field of 2D image signal
   processing, it has not received enough attention in the field of 1D
   signal processing. This paper proposes a novel approach that diagnoses
   the fault of a rolling bearing based on fast NIL-Means and the envelop
   spectrum. The parameters of the rolling bearing signals are optimized in
   the proposed method, which is the key contribution of this paper. This
   approach is applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling bearing, and the
   results have shown the efficiency at detecting roller bearing failures.},

Abstract = {The traditional bearing fault detection method is achieved often by
   sampling the bearing vibration data under the Shannon sampling theorem.
   Then the information of the bearing state can be extracted from the
   vibration data, which is used in fault detection. A long-term and
   continuous monitoring needs to sample and store large amounts of raw
   vibration signals, which will burden the data storage and transmission
   greatly. For this problem, a new bearing fault detection method based on
   compressed sensing is presented, which just needs to sample and store a
   small amount of compressed observation data and uses these data directly
   to achieve the fault detection. Firstly, an over-complete dictionary is
   trained, on which the vibration signals corresponded to normal state can
   be decomposed sparsely. Then, the bearing fault detection can be
   achieved based on the difference of the sparse representation errors
   between the compressed signals in normal state and fault state on this
   dictionary. The fault detection results of the proposed method with
   different parameters are analyzed. The effectiveness of the method is
   validated by the experimental tests.},

Title = {Smoothness index-guided Bayesian inference for determining joint
   posterior probability distributions of anti-symmetric real Laplace
   wavelet parameters for identification of different bearing faults},

Abstract = {Rolling element bearings are one of the most common components used in
   machines and they are used to support rotating shafts. Unexpected
   bearing failures may cause machine breakdown which results in economic
   loss. Detection of bearing faults is crucial to prevent bearing
   failures. Vibration based signal processing methods have been proven to
   be effective in identifying different bearing faults. Among different
   signal processing methods, wavelet analysis is widely investigated
   because it is able to highlight the similarity between wavelet functions
   with different wavelet parameters and impulses caused by bearing faults.
   In wavelet analysis, two topics are of great concern. The first is how
   to choose a suitable wavelet mother function for bearing fault
   diagnosis. In recent studies, an anti symmetric real Laplace wavelet or
   impulse response wavelet has been experimentally proven to have a high
   similarity with impulses caused by bearing faults. Therefore, anti
   symmetric real Laplace wavelet is chosen as the wavelet mother function
   in this paper. The second is how to determine the optimal wavelet
   parameters so as to enhance the ability of wavelet analysis. Based on
   the anti symmetric real Laplace wavelet, smoothness index based Bayesian
   inference is proposed in this paper to establish joint posterior
   probability density functions of wavelet parameters, which reflect
   graphical relationships between wavelet parameters. The smoothness index
   is chosen because it is not only able to quantify bearing fault signals,
   but also has upper and lower bounds, compared with other metrics, such
   as wavelet entropy, Shannon entropy, kurtosis, sparsity measurement,
   etc. For Bayesian inference, a general particle filter is adopted to
   iteratively calculate and update joint posterior probability density
   functions of wavelet parameters. Once the joint posterior probability
   density functions of wavelet parameters are available, the optimal
   wavelet parameters are determined and an optimal wavelet filtering is
   conducted to extract bearing fault signatures. Real case studies are
   investigated to illustrate how the proposed method works. The results
   show that the proposed method can determine joint posterior probability
   density functions of wavelet parameters and is effective in identifying
   different bearing faults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fault diagnosis is essentially a kind of pattern recognition. The
   measured signal samples usually distribute on nonlinear low-dimensional
   manifolds embedded in the high-dimensional signal space, so how to
   implement feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and improve
   recognition performance is a crucial task. In this paper a novel
   machinery fault diagnosis approach based on a statistical locally linear
   embedding (S-LLE) algorithm which is an extension of LLE by exploiting
   the fault class label information is proposed. The fault diagnosis
   approach first extracts the intrinsic manifold features from the
   high-dimensional feature vectors which are obtained from vibration
   signals that feature extraction by time-domain, frequency-domain and
   empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and then translates the complex mode
   space into a salient low-dimensional feature space by the manifold
   learning algorithm S-LLE, which outperforms other feature reduction
   methods such as PCA, LDA and LLE. Finally in the feature reduction space
   pattern classification and fault diagnosis by classifier are carried out
   easily and rapidly. Rolling bearing fault signals are used to validate
   the proposed fault diagnosis approach. The results indicate that the
   proposed approach obviously improves the classification performance of
   fault pattern recognition and outperforms the other traditional
   approaches.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a rolling bearing fault diagnosis approach by
   integrating wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) with multi-scale
   permutation entropy (MPE). The approach uses MPE values of the
   sub-frequency band signals to identify faults appearing in rolling
   bearings. Specifically, vibration signals measured from a rolling
   bearing test system with different defect conditions are decomposed into
   a set of sub-frequency band signals by means of the WPD method. Then,
   each sub-frequency band signal is divided into a series of subsequences,
   and MPEs of all subsequences in corresponding sub-frequency band signal
   are calculated. After that, the average MPE value of all subsequences
   about each sub-frequency band is calculated, and is considered as the
   fault feature of the corresponding sub-frequency band. Subsequently, MPE
   values of all sub-frequency bands are considered as input feature
   vectors, and the hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to identify the fault
   pattern of the rolling bearing. Experimental study on a data set from
   the Case Western Reserve University bearing data center has shown that
   the presented approach can accurately identify faults in rolling
   bearings.},

Title = {A Novel Characteristic Frequency Bands Extraction Method for Automatic
   Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on Hilbert Huang Transform},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Abstract = {Because roller element bearings (REBs) failures cause unexpected
   machinery breakdowns, their fault diagnosis has attracted considerable
   research attention. Established fault feature extraction methods focus
   on statistical characteristics of the vibration signal, which is an
   approach that loses sight of the continuous waveform features.
   Considering this weakness, this article proposes a novel feature
   extraction method for frequency bands, named Window Marginal Spectrum
   Clustering (WMSC) to select salient features from the marginal spectrum
   of vibration signals by Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). In WMSC, a
   sliding window is used to divide an entire HHT marginal spectrum (HMS)
   into window spectrums, following which Rand Index (RI) criterion of
   clustering method is used to evaluate each window. The windows returning
   higher RI values are selected to construct characteristic frequency
   bands (CFBs). Next, a hybrid REBs fault diagnosis is constructed, termed
   by its elements, HHT-WMSC-SVM (support vector machines). The
   effectiveness of HHT-WMSC-SVM is validated by running series of
   experiments on REBs defect datasets from the Bearing Data Center of Case
   Western Reserve University (CWRU). The said test results evidence three
   major advantages of the novel method. First, the fault classification
   accuracy of the HHT-WMSC-SVM model is higher than that of HHT-SVM and
   ST-SVM, which is a method that combines statistical characteristics with
   SVM. Second, with Gauss white noise added to the original REBs defect
   dataset, the HHT-WMSC-SVM model maintains high classification accuracy,
   while the classification accuracy of ST-SVM and HHT-SVM models are
   significantly reduced. Third, fault classification accuracy by
   HHT-WMSC-SVM can exceed 95\% under a Pmin range of 500-800 and a m range
   of 50-300 for REBs defect dataset, adding Gauss white noise at Signal
   Noise Ratio (SNR) = 5. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
   WMSC method yields a high REBs fault classification accuracy and a good
   performance in Gauss white noise reduction.},

Abstract = {This study examined scaling properties of an increment series from
   rotating machinery. Moreover, two fluctuation parameters for the
   smallest and largest time scales of a scaling range served as a pair of
   fluctuation parameters to describe system conditions. Therefore, an
   interesting phenomenon is observed: the data points, each representing a
   pair of fluctuation parameters, for fault conditions almost form a
   straight line, while those for normal clearly depart from the straight
   line. To describe the phenomenon, a novel concept termed the diagnostic
   line was introduced. Subsequently, properties of the diagnostic line
   were carefully investigated theoretically and numerically. Consequently,
   a decisive role of noise in forming the diagnostic line was determined.
   Accordingly, this study develops a novel criterion for condition
   monitoring of rotating machinery. (C) 2015 ISA. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Vibration-based rolling element bearing diagnostics is a very
   well-developed field, yet researchers continue to develop new diagnostic
   algorithms quite frequently. Over the last decade, data from the Case
   Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center has become a
   standard reference used to test these algorithms, yet without any
   recognised benchmark it is difficult to properly assess the performance
   of any proposed diagnostic methods. There is, then, a clear need to
   examine the data thoroughly and to categorise it appropriately, and this
   paper intends to fulfil that objective. To do so, three established
   diagnostic techniques are applied to the entire CWRU data set, and the
   diagnostic outcomes are provided and discussed in detail.
   Recommendations are given as to how the data might best be used, and
   also on how any future benchmark data should be generated. Though
   intended primarily as a benchmark to aid in testing new diagnostic
   algorithms, it is also hoped that much of the discussion will have
   broader applicability to other bearing diagnostics cases. (C) 2015

Title = {Modified Kernel Marginal Fisher Analysis for Feature Extraction and Its
   Application to Bearing Fault Diagnosis},
Journal = {SHOCK AND VIBRATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {The high-dimensional features of defective bearings usually include
   redundant and irrelevant information, which will degrade the diagnosis
   performance. Thus, it is critical to extract the sensitive
   low-dimensional characteristics for improving diagnosis performance.
   This paper proposes modified kernel marginal Fisher analysis (MKMFA) for
   feature extraction with dimensionality reduction. Due to its outstanding
   performance in enhancing the intraclass compactness and interclass
   dispersibility, MKMFA is capable of effectively extracting the sensitive
   low-dimensional manifold characteristics beneficial to subsequent
   pattern classification even for few training samples. A MKMFA-based
   fault diagnosis model is presented and applied to identify different
   bearing faults. It firstly utilizes MKMFA to directly extract the
   low-dimensional manifold characteristics from the raw time-series signal
   samples in high-dimensional ambient space. Subsequently, the sensitive
   low-dimensional characteristics in feature space are inputted into
   K-nearest neighbor classifier so as to distinguish various fault
   patterns. The four-fault-type and ten-fault-severity bearing fault
   diagnosis experiment results show the feasibility and superiority of the
   proposed scheme in comparison with the other five methods.},

   Total Variation Denoising},
Journal = {SHOCK AND VIBRATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {Wavelet analysis is a powerful tool for signal processing and mechanical
   equipment fault diagnosis due to the advantages of multiresolution
   analysis and excellent local characteristics in time-frequency domain.
   Wavelet total variation (WATV) was recently developed based on the
   traditional wavelet analysis method, which combines the advantages of
   wavelet-domain sparsity and total variation (TV) regularization. In
   order to guarantee the sparsity and the convexity of the total objective
   function, nonconvex penalty function is chosen as a new wavelet penalty
   function in WATV. The actual noise reduction effect of WATV method
   largely depends on the estimation of the noise signal variance. In this
   paper, an improved wavelet total variation (IWATV) denoising method was
   introduced. The local variance analysis on wavelet coefficients obtained
   from the wavelet decomposition of noisy signals is employed to estimate
   the noise variance so as to provide a scientific evaluation index.
   Through the analysis of the numerical simulation signal and real-word
   failure data, the results demonstrated that the IWATV method has obvious
   advantages over the traditional wavelet threshold denoising and total
   variation denoising method in the mechanical fault diagnose.},

Abstract = {Vibration signal analysis is one of the most effective methods for

   time domain analysis and adaptive fuzzy C-means clustering. By analyzing
   vibration signal collected, nine common time domain parameters are
   calculated. This lot of data constitutes data matrix as characteristic
   vectors to be detected. And using adaptive fuzzy C-means clustering, the
   optimal clustering number can be gotten then to recognize different
   fault types. Moreover, five parameters, including variance, RMS,
   kurtosis, skewness, and crest factor, of the nine are selected as the
   new eigenvector matrix to be clustered for more optimal clustering
   performance. The test results demonstrate that the proposed approach has
   a sensitive reflection towards fault identifications, including slight
   fault.},

Title = {A Fault Diagnosis Method for Rolling Bearings Based on Feature Fusion of
   Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and Alpha Stable
   Distribution},
Journal = {SHOCK AND VIBRATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {When rolling bearings fail, it is usually difficult to determine the
   degree of damage. To address this problem, a new fault diagnosis method
   was developed to perform feature extraction and intelligent
   classification of various fault position and damage degree of rolling
   bearing signals. Firstly, Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
   (MFDFA) was used to compute five MFDFA features while five Alpha Stable
   Distribution (ASD) features were obtained by fitting the distribution to
   the vibration signals of each status and calculating the Probability
   Density Function (PDF). Secondly, Kernel Principle Component Analysis
   (KPCA) was used to achieve dimensionality reduction fusion of the
   combination of original features to gain the Kernel Principle Component
   Fusion Features (KPCFFs). Thirdly, the KPCFFs served as the input of
   Least Squares Support Vectors Machine (LSSVM) based on Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) to assess rolling bearings' fault position and damage
   severity. Finally, the effectiveness of the method was validated by
   bench test data. The results demonstrated that the developed method can
   achieve intelligent diagnosis of rolling bearings' fault position and
   damage degree and can yield better diagnosis accuracy than single
   feature method or corresponding single feature fusion method.},

Abstract = {Damage assessment is very meaningful to keep safety and reliability of
   machinery components, and vibration analysis is an effective way to
   carry out the damage assessment. In this paper, a damage index is
   designed by performing manifold distance analysis on vibration signal.
   To calculate the index, vibration signal is collected firstly, and
   feature extraction is carried out to obtain statistical features that
   can capture signal characteristics comprehensively. Then, manifold
   learning algorithm is utilized to decompose feature matrix to be a
   subspace, that is, manifold subspace. The manifold learning algorithm
   seeks to keep local relationship of the feature matrix, which is more
   meaningful for damage assessment. Finally, Grassmann distance between
   manifold subspaces is defined as a damage index. The Grassmann distance
   reflecting manifold structure is a suitable metric to measure distance
   between subspaces in the manifold. The defined damage index is applied
   to damage assessment of a rotor and the bearing, and the result
   validates its effectiveness for damage assessment of machinery
   component. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Rolling bearings are widely used in rotary machinery systems. The
   measured vibration signal of any part linked to rolling bearings
   contains fault information when failure occurs, differing only by energy
   levels. Bearing failure will cause the vibration of other components,
   and therefore the collected bearing vibration signals are mixed with
   vibration signal of other parts and noise. Using multiple sensors to
   collect signals at different locations on the machine to obtain
   multivariate signal can avoid the loss of local information.
   Subsequently using the multivariate empirical mode decomposition
   (multivariate EMD) to simultaneously analyze the multivariate signal is
   beneficial to extract fault information, especially for weak fault
   characteristics during the period of early failure. This paper proposes
   a novel method for fault feature extraction of rolling, bearing based on
   multivariate EMD. The nonlocal means (NL-means) denoising method is used
   to preprocess the multivariate signal and the correlation analysis is
   employed to calculate fault correlation factors to select effective
   intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Finally characteristic frequencies are
   extracted from the selected IMFs by spectrum analysis. The numerical
   simulations and applications to bearing monitoring verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed method and indicate that this novel method
   is promising in the field of signal decomposition and fault diagnosis.

Abstract = {Bearing failure is one of the dominant causes of failure and breakdowns
   in rotating machinery, leading to huge economic loss. Aiming at the
   nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics of bearing vibration signals
   as well as the complexity of condition-indicating information
   distribution in the signals, a novel rolling element bearing fault
   diagnosis method based on multifractal theory and gray relation theory
   was proposed in the paper. Firstly, a generalized multifractal dimension
   algorithm was developed to extract the characteristic vectors of fault
   features from the bearing vibration signals, which can offer more
   meaningful and distinguishing information reflecting different bearing
   health status in comparison with conventional single fractal dimension.
   After feature extraction by multifractal dimensions, an adaptive gray
   relation algorithm was applied to implement an automated bearing fault
   pattern recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed
   method can identify various bearing fault types as well as severities
   effectively and accurately.},

Abstract = {The properties of the time domain parameters of vibration signals have
   been extensively studied for the fault diagnosis of rolling element
   bearings (REBs). Parameters like kurtosis and Envelope Harmonic-to-Noise
   Ratio are the most widely applied in this field and some important
   progress has been made. However, since only one-sided information is
   contained in these parameters, problems still exist in practice when the
   signals collected are of complicated structure and/or contaminated by
   strong background noises. A new parameter, named Shock Pulse Index
   (SPI), is proposed in this paper. It integrates the mutual advantages of
   both the parameters mentioned above and can help effectively identify
   fault-related impulse components under conditions of interference of
   strong background noises, unrelated harmonic components and random
   impulses. The SPI optimizes the parameters of Maximum Correlated
   Kurtosis Deconvolution (MCKD), which is used to filter the signals under
   consideration. Finally, the transient information of interest contained
   in the filtered signal can be highlighted through demodulation with the
   Teager Energy Operator (TEO). Fault-related impulse components can
   therefore be extracted accurately. Simulations show the SPI can
   correctly indicate the fault impulses under the influence of strong
   background noises, other harmonic components and aperiodic impulse and
   experiment analyses verify the effectiveness and correctness of the
   proposed method.},

Abstract = {Fault diagnosis for rolling bearings has attracted increasing attention
   in recent years. However, few studies have focused on fault diagnosis
   for rolling bearings under variable conditions. This paper introduces a
   fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings under variable conditions
   based on visual cognition. The proposed method includes the following
   steps. First, the vibration signal data are transformed into a
   recurrence plot (RP), which is a two-dimensional image. Then, inspired
   by the visual invariance characteristic of the human visual system
   (HVS), we utilize speed up robust feature to extract fault features from
   the two-dimensional RP and generate a 64-dimensional feature vector,
   which is invariant to image translation, rotation, scaling variation,
   etc. Third, based on the manifold perception characteristic of HVS,
   isometric mapping, a manifold learning method that can reflect the
   intrinsic manifold embedded in the high-dimensional space, is employed
   to obtain a low-dimensional feature vector. Finally, a classical
   classification method, support vector machine, is utilized to realize
   fault diagnosis. Verification data were collected from Case Western
   Reserve University Bearing Data Center, and the experimental result
   indicates that the proposed fault diagnosis method based on visual
   cognition is highly effective for rolling bearings under variable
   conditions, thus providing a promising approach from the cognitive
   computing field.},

Abstract = {The monitored vibration signal of bearing is usually nonlinear and
   nonstationary, and may be corrupted by background noise. Thus, it is
   very difficult to accurately extract sensitive and reliable
   characteristics information from the vibration signal to diagnose
   bearing health conditions. This paper proposes a novel bearing fault
   diagnosis method based on sparse discriminant manifold projections
   (SDMP). The SDMP was developed based on sparsity preserving projections,
   and sparse manifold clustering and embedding. The SDMP can effectively
   extract the meaningful low-dimensional intrinsic features that hidden in
   a high-dimensional feature dataset. After dimensionality reduction with
   the SDMP, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is utilized
   to classify the different low-dimensional feature data for fault
   recognition. The effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed method
   are demonstrated through several comparative experiments with other
   three manifold learning methods. The experimental results validate that
   the SDMP is more effective than the other three manifold learning
   methods for implementation bearing fault diagnosis, and it is more
   robust when deal with noise interference signal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Fault Detection for Vibration Signals on Rolling Bearings Based on the
   Symplectic Entropy Method},
Journal = {ENTROPY},

Abstract = {Bearing vibration response studies are crucial for the condition
   monitoring of bearings and the quality inspection of rotating machinery
   systems. However, it is still very difficult to diagnose bearing faults,
   especially rolling element faults, due to the complex, high-dimensional
   and nonlinear characteristics of vibration signals as well as the strong
   background noise. A novel nonlinear analysis method-the symplectic
   entropy (SymEn) measure-is proposed to analyze the measured signals for
   fault monitoring of rolling bearings. The core technique of the SymEn
   approach is the entropy analysis based on the symplectic principal
   components. The dynamical characteristics of the rolling bearing data
   are analyzed using the SymEn method. Unlike other techniques consisting
   of high-dimensional features in the time-domain, frequency-domain and
   the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)/wavelet-domain, the SymEn
   approach constructs low-dimensional (i.e., two-dimensional) features
   based on the SymEn estimate. The vibration signals from our experiments
   and the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center are applied
   to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Meanwhile, it is
   found that faulty bearings have a great influence on the other normal
   bearings. To sum up, the results indicate that the proposed method can
   be used to detect rolling bearing faults.},

Title = {Incipient Fault Feature Extraction of Rolling Bearings Using
   Autocorrelation Function Impulse Harmonic to Noise Ratio Index Based SVD
   and Teager Energy Operator},

Abstract = {The periodic impulse feature is the most typical fault signature of the
   vibration signal from fault rolling element bearings (REBs). However, it
   is easily contaminated by noise and interference harmonics. In order to
   extract the incipient impulse feature from the fault vibration signal,
   this paper presented an autocorrelation function periodic impulse
   harmonic to noise ratio (ACFHNR) index based on the SVD-Teager energy
   operator (TEO) method. Firstly, the Hankel matrix is constructed based
   on the raw vibration fault signal of rolling bearing, and the SVD method
   is used to obtain the singular components. Afterwards, the ACFHNR index
   is employed to measure the abundance of the periodic impulse fault
   feature for the singular components, and the component with the largest
   ACFHNR index value is extracted. Moreover, the properties of the ACFHNR
   index are demonstrated by simulations and the full life cycle of the
   experiment, showing its superiority over the traditional kurtosis and
   root mean square (RMS) index for extracting and detecting incipient
   periodic impulse features. Finally, the Teager energy operator spectrum
   of the extracted informative signal is gained. The simulation and
   experimental results indicated that the proposed ACFHNR index based
   method can effectively detect the incipient fault feature of the rolling
   bearing, and it shows better performance than the kurtosis and RMS index
   based methods.},

   critical task in machine health monitoring. This paper presents an
   automatic fault diagnosis of bearing based on the feature extraction
   using Wavelet Packet Analysis, feature selection using Autoencoder, and
   feature classification using Particle Swarm Optimization - Support
   Vector Machine. First, bearing vibration signals are decomposed at
   different depth levels by Wavelet Packet Analysis. Then the wavelet
   packet coefficients are used to compute the energy value of the
   corresponding wavelet packet node. After that, an Autoencoder is
   exploited to select the most sensitive features from the feature set.
   Finally, classification is done by using a Support Vector Machine
   classifier whose parameters are optimized by Particle Swarm
   Optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed intelligent fault
   diagnosis scheme is validated by experiments with bearing data of Case
   Western Reserve University bearing data center.},

Abstract = {Resolution coefficient of traditional gray relation classifier usually
   takes a fixed value of 0.5, which greatly limits the adaptive ability,
   and reduces the effectiveness of this algorithm to identify signals. To
   solve this problem, an improved optimized resolution coefficient
   algorithm of gray relation classifier was proposed. Particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to calculate the optimized
   resolution coefficient corresponding to the best classification results
   under different SNR environment. The adaptive ability of this algorithm
   was improved by improving the selection method of resolution coefficient
   and ultimately the classification effect was improved. Simulation
   results show that, compared with the traditional improved algorithm, it
   can improve the recognition rate of signals under different SNR
   environment, and have a good application value.},

Abstract = {Aiming at the limitations of traditional fractal box-counting dimension
   algorithm in the application of subtle feature extraction of radiation
   source signals, an improved generalized fractal box-counting dimension
   algorithm is proposed in the paper. Firstly, the signal is preprocessed,
   and the real and imaginary data of the signal after Hilbert transform is
   extracted to obtain the instantaneous amplitude of the signal; Then, the
   improved fractal box-counting dimension of signal instantaneous
   amplitude is extracted as the first eigenvector; At the same time, the
   improved fractal box-counting dimension of the signal without Hilbert
   transform is extracted as the second eigenvector; Finally, the dual
   improved fractal box-counting dimension eigenvectors form the
   multidimensional eigenvectors to form a new fractal box-counting
   dimension eigenvector as signal subtle features, for radiation source
   signal recognition. By establishing a dual improved fractal box-counting
   dimension feature space, 11 different practical radiation source signals
   are classified, compared with the traditional box-counting dimension
   algorithm, and the recognition rate is calculated. The experimental
   results show that compared with the traditional fractal box-counting
   dimension algorithm and the single improved fractal box-counting
   dimension algorithm, the proposed dual improved fractal box-counting
   dimension algorithm, can better reflect the signal subtle distribution
   characteristics under the different reconstruction phase space, and has
   a better recognition effect with good real-time performance.},

Abstract = {A new self-adaptive signal decomposition method called empirical wavelet

   and wavelet transform. In this method, the vibration signal of rolling

   bearing fault detect based on EWT. First applied EWT to rolling bearing
   vibration signals. Then calculated the normalized correlation
   coefficients of each order IMF with original signal respectively. The
   sensitive IMF is selected according to the normalized correlation
   coefficient and each order IMF kurtosis factor. Finally, the Hilbert
   transform to the sensitive IMF and using this envelope spectrum to
   bearing fault diagnosis. The experiment results show that the proposed
   method provides a good performance in the detection of outer and inner

Abstract = {Roller bearings play a significant role in kinds of machine. In most
   cases, it won't work in steadily operational conditions. The paper
   proposed a method which combines empirical mode decomposition and
   auto-regressive model to extract features of faults in various
   operational conditions and uses random forests to set an effective
   pattern recognition model. In addition, the paper compares the result of
   random forests with that of some other classification method. The
   bearing vibration data comes from Case Western Reserve University
   Bearing Data Center. The result indicates that the method is effective
   and can be used in actual situations.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a general data-driven diagnostic scheme to classify
   bearing faults in induction motors. Case western reserve university
   bearing data center are used to create two scenarios with different
   fault diameters of 0.007 and 0.014 that are induced in the inner race,
   the ball and the outer race. The diagnostic system could successfully
   conduct signal processing and classification steps to achieve an
   accurate condition assessment of the motor. In this work, the vibration
   signal is decomposed into several number of components by means of five
   different state-of-the-arts signal processing techniques. The extracted
   features which belong to the Time-domain, the Frequency-domain and the
   Time-Frequency domain are employed to create a pool of diverse features.
   Moreover, a feature selection strategy based on the correlation of the
   features to motor operating conditions is assessed. The obtained result
   shows that the combination of the most correlated features could provide
   an informative feature set for the fault classification and improve the
   diagnostic accuracy. In addition, feature selection can reduce the model
   complexity and facilitate the learning process of the fault classifiers.},

Abstract = {As the rolling bearing vibration signal is of nonlinear and
   nonstationary characteristics, the condition-indicating information
   distributed in the rolling bearing vibration signal is complicated, and
   using traditional time domain and frequency domain approaches cannot
   easily make an accurate estimation for the rolling bearing health
   status. In this paper, a simple and efficient fault diagnostic approach
   was proposed to accommodate to the requirements of both real-time
   monitoring and accurate estimation of fault type as well as severity.
   Firstly, a four-dimensional feature extraction algorithm using entropy
   and Holder coefficient theories was developed to extract the
   characteristic vector from the vibration signals, and secondly a gray
   relation algorithm was employed for achieving bearing fault pattern
   recognition intelligently. The experimental study have illustrated the
   proposed approach can efficiently and effectively improve the fault
   diagnostic performance compared with the existing artificial intelligent
   methods, and can be suitable for on-line health status estimation.},

Abstract = {An automatic classification method based on deep learning for bearing
   fault diagnosis is proposed. The method is designed with the ability of
   faulty signal automatic clustering without human knowledge. A dataset in
   which each sample is given a random label is configured after extracting
   the features of vibration signals from the frequency domain. The dataset
   is used to train a deep neural network (DNN) to obtain the initial
   classification. The classification results are assessed by testing the
   subsignals extracted from the raw data, and the sample labels are
   modified according to the evaluation result. The modified dataset is
   used to train the DNN a second time. Samples with characteristic faults
   are clustered in various classes after iterating the DNN training and
   testing. The proposed method is tested with the bearing data provided by
   the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center, which is
   a standard reference to test fault detection algorithms. The 12k drive
   end, 48k drive end, and 12k fan end CWRU bearing data are classified
   into 7, 6, and 4 groups, respectively. The testing results show that the
   proposed method can achieve automatic clustering for vibration signals
   with a variety of faults.},

Abstract = {A novel bearing fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper, which
   is based on Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) with energy entropy. In
   this method, first the vibration signal of rolling bearing is decomposed
   by the EWT, and several AM-FM components are obtained. Then calculated
   the energy entropy of each IMFs respectively and the sensitive IMF is
   selected according to the value of energy entropy. Finally, the Hilbert
   transform to the sensitive IMF and using the envelope spectrum to detect
   bearing fault characteristic frequency. The experiment results show that
   the proposed method is accurate and can provide a good performance in
   the outer race, inner race and rolling element faults detection.},

Journal = {SHOCK AND VIBRATION},

Abstract = {A method based on wavelet and deep neural network for rolling-element
   bearing fault data automatic clustering is proposed. The method can
   achieve intelligent signal classification without human knowledge. The
   time-domain vibration signals are decomposed by wavelet packet transform
   (WPT) to obtain eigenvectors that characterize fault types. By using the
   eigenvectors, a dataset in which samples are labeled randomly is
   configured. The dataset is roughly classified by the distance-based
   clustering method. A fine classification process based on deep neural
   network is followed to achieve accurate classification. The entire
   process is automatically completed, which can effectively overcome the
   shortcomings such as low work efficiency, high implementation cost, and
   large classification error caused by individual participation. The
   proposed method is tested with the bearing data provided by the Case
   Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center. The testing
   results show that the proposed method has good performance in automatic
   clustering of rolling-element bearings fault data.},

   detection and segmentation approaches, that could be used in REB fault
   detection and diagnosis, implemented in a specialized Matlab toolbox. In
   this framework, an approach for change detection and optimal
   segmentation of vibrating signals, with the object to determine the
   change points in the signals generated by the faults produced during REB

Abstract = {Advanced monitoring requires automatic diagnosis of machines operating
   under variable conditions. In this paper, an intelligent method is
   introduced in order to enhance the classification and achieves a higher
   precision for the diagnosis of degradation of rolling bearings operating
   under condition variations. The method uses the coefficients of
   autoregressive modeling (AR) of the bearing vibration signal as the
   features of a classifier. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) of the
   matrix feature obtained from AR analysis is applied in order to extract
   the components that discriminate the different fault modes since it is
   insensitive to the working conditions. Finally, the results obtained
   from LDA are used as the input of a support Vector Machine (SVM)
   classifier to automatically identify the bearing state. The experimental
   results show that the performance of the proposed method is effective
   and achieve a good accuracy.},

Title = {A Novel Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Noise-Assisted MEMD and
   Functional Neural Fuzzy Network for Rolling Element Bearings},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {27048-27068},
Abstract = {To solve the problem in which the auxiliary white-noise parameters need
   to be artificially selected in a noise-assisted multivariate empirical
   mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) and considering the fact that obtaining a
   large number of typical fault samples in practical engineering is
   difficult, a rolling bearing fault-diagnosis method based on velocity
   modified-mutation particle swarm optimization (PSO)-optimized NA-MEMD
   and improved functional neural fuzzy network (FNFN) is proposed. First,
   the original vibration signal is processed using the velocity
   modified-mutation PSO NA-MEMD method to decompose it into a series of
   intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different characteristic time
   scales. Owing to the distribution characteristics of the IMF with the
   time scales and because the energy in different states of a bearing in
   different frequency bands changes, we calculate the energy moment of
   each IMF as a fault feature vector. Second, the fault feature vectors
   are then used as input to construct the improved FNFN structure.
   Finally, the method is validated using the data from the bearing data
   center of Case Western Reserve University and the vibration signals of
   the propulsion-motor bearings in the rudder paddle compartment during
   normal ship navigation and is compared with other neural network. The
   results show that the method proposed in this paper can quickly and more
   accurately diagnose rolling-bearing faults using limited training
   samples.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the accuracy of bearings fault diagnosis, one of the
   most crucial components of rotating machinery, a novel features
   extraction procedure incorporating an improved features dimensionality
   reduction method is proposed. In the first step, using the empirical
   mode decomposition method, the original statistical characteristics were
   calculated from intrinsic mode functions of the vibration signal. Due to
   information redundancy of the original statistical characteristics, this
   paper presents a novel features extraction method that combines K-means
   method and standard deviation to select the most sensitive
   characteristics. Furthermore, a modified features dimensionality
   reduction method is proposed, to realize the low-dimensional
   representations for high-dimensional feature space. Finally, the
   performance of the fault diagnosis model is evaluated by vibration
   signals with 12 bearing fault conditions, which are provided by Bearing
   Data Center of Case Western Reserve University. Experiment results show
   that the proposed fault diagnosis model can serve as an effective and
   adaptive bearing fault diagnosis system.},

Abstract = {An adaptive mode decomposition method based on empirical wavelet
   transform (EWT) and spectral kurtosis (SK) is proposed for rolling
   bearing fault diagnosis. First, by applying EWT the raw vibration signal
   of rolling bearing is decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions
   (IMFs) are obtained. Then the IMFs which mostly characterizes fault
   information is selected according to energy entropy. Finally, the
   selected IMF signal is further filtered by an optimal band-pass filter
   based on SK to extract impulse signal. Fault identification can be
   deduced by the appearance of fault characteristic frequencies in the
   squared envelope spectrum of the filtered signal. The experiment results
   show that the proposed method certain advantages and provides better
   effect in the detection of outer race, inner race and rolling element
   faults.},

Abstract = {Similarity-based modeling (SBM) is a technique whereby the normal
   operation of a system is modeled in order to detect faults by analyzing
   their similarity to the normal system states. First proposed around two
   decades ago, SBM has been successfully used for fault detection in
   varied systems. In spite of this success, there is not much study
   performed in the literature regarding its design, that encompasses both
   similarity metrics and model training. This work aims at contributing
   with an in-depth study of SBM for fault detection considering these two
   design aspects. This is done in the context of proposing a novel system
   to identify rotating-machinery faults based on SBM, that is employed
   either as a standalone classifier or to generate features for a random
   forest classifier. New approaches for training the model and new
   similarity metrics are investigated. Experimental results are shown for
   the recently developed Machinery Fault Database (MaFaulDa) that has an
   extensive set of sequences and fault types, and for the Case Western
   Reserve University (CWRU) bearing database. Results for both databases
   indicate that the proposed techniques increase the generalization power
   of the similarity model and of the associated classifier, achieving
   accuracies of 98.5\% on MaFaulDa and 98.9\% on CWRU database. (c) 2017

  abstract = {Rotating equipment is considered as a key component in several industrial sectors. In fact, the continuous operation of many industrial machines such as sub-sea pumps and gas turbines relies on the correct performance of their rotating equipment. In order to reduce the probability of malfunctions in this equipment, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis systems are essential. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to perform fault diagnosis in rotating equipment based on permutation entropy, signal processing, and artificial intelligence. To that aim, vibration signals are employed for an indication of bearing performance. In order to facilitate fault diagnosis, fault detection and isolation are performed in two separate steps. As first, once a vibration signal is received, the faulty state of the bearing is determined by permutation entropy. In case a faulty state is detected, the fault type is determined using an approach based on signal processing and artificial intelligence. Wavelet packet transform and envelope analysis of the vibration signals are utilized to extract the frequency components of the fault. The proposed approach allows for the automatic selection of a frequency band that includes the characteristic resonance frequency of the fault, which is subject to change in different operational conditions. The method works by extracting the proper features of the signals that are used to decide about the faulty bearing’s condition by a multi-output adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system classifier. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed by the Case Western Reserve University dataset: the analysis demonstrates the proposed method’s capabilities in accurately diagnosing faults in rotating equipment as compared to existing approaches.},

abstract = {We present the asymptotic distribution of the Rényi and Tsallis/Havrda–Charvát entropies and the Fisher information measure of ordinal patterns embedding their serial correlation. We study the convergence behavior of the asymptotic variance for some types of dynamics and the permutation entropy to the limit distribution. These results lead to tests for comparing the underlying dynamics of two time series. We apply these tests to discriminate uniform white noise, logistic maps with Gaussian noise, fractional Brownian motion, and f−k noise, with k∈{0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5}. We also applied these tests to cryptocurrency open prices data, with favorable results. We provide the R code that implements the functions.}

abstract = {Feature selection is an essential problem for pattern classification systems. This paper studies how to provide systems with the most characterizing features for ordinal multi-class classification task. The integration of cluster analyses and variability analyses advances a novel feature selection scheme with efficiency. The Huang-index method using fuzzy c-means is employed to enhance cluster validity and optimizes a consistent number of clusters among the features. A new entropy-based feature evaluation method is formulated for the authentication of relevant features. Then, multivariate statistical analyses are utilized to solve the redundancy between relevant features. Experimental results show that our new feature selection scheme sifts successfully a compact subset of characterizing features for classification problems with multiple classes.}

  abstract = {Ordinal patterns serve as a robust symbolic transformation technique, enabling the unveiling of latent dynamics within time series data. This methodology involves constructing histograms of patterns, followed by the calculation of both entropy and statistical complexity—an avenue yet to be fully understood in terms of its statistical properties. While asymptotic results can be derived by assuming a multinomial distribution for histogram proportions, the challenge emerges from the non-independence present in the sequence of ordinal patterns. Consequently, the direct application of the multinomial assumption is questionable. This study focuses on the computation of the asymptotic distribution of permutation entropy, considering the inherent patterns’ correlation structure. Furthermore, the research delves into a comparative analysis, pitting this distribution against the entropy derived from a multinomial law. We present simulation algorithms for sampling time series with prescribed histograms of patterns and transition probabilities between them. Through this analysis, we better understand the intricacies of ordinal patterns and their statistical attributes.},

  abstract = {It has been demonstrated that the construction of ordinal partition transition networks (OPTNs) from time series provides a prospective approach to improve our understanding of the underlying dynamical system. In this work, we introduce a suite of OPTN based complexity measures to infer the coupling direction between two dynamical systems from pairs of time series. For several examples of coupled stochastic processes, we demonstrate that our approach is able to successfully identify interaction delays of both unidirectional and bidirectional coupling configurations. Moreover, we show that the causal interaction between two coupled chaotic Hénon maps can be captured by the OPTN based complexity measures for a broad range of coupling strengths before the onset of synchronization. Finally, we apply our method to two real-world observational climate time series, disclosing the interaction delays underlying the temperature records from two distinct stations in Oxford and Vienna. Our results suggest that ordinal partition transition networks can be used as complementary tools for causal inference tasks and provide insights into the potentials and theoretical foundations of time series networks.},

  abstract = {Complexity-entropy causality plane (CECP) and ordinal transition network (OTN) are both crucial tools to reveal the characteristics of time series and distinguish complex systems. However, when the parameters of the system to be distinguished have a wide range of values, the distinguishing function of CECP is weakened. Therefore, we propose a new measure called transition Fisher information (TFI) based on the probability transition matrix in OTN. The TFI is combined with conditional entropy of ordinal patterns and complexity measure to form a novel three-dimensional graph, called transition-based complexity-entropy causality diagram(TB-CECD). These three statistics depict the complex system from different angles. Through simulation experiments, we prove that even if the parameters of complex systems are wide-ranging, the systems of different properties can be assigned to different areas of the graph. Moreover, we find that the trace of the transition probability matrix can be seen as a function of time delay and used to reflect the periodic information of the system. For applications, the proposed methods are applied to vehicle dynamic response data to diagnose periodic short-wave defects such as rail corrugation. The financial time series and Electroencephalographic (EEG) time series are also researched.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new approach to measure the dynamical complexity of a single time series. We characterize the changes of the states of the underlying system, by quantifying the Markov states transition between adjacent permutations. Unlike many static-complexity measures, the new method of permutation transition entropy (PTE) is able to identify the dynamical complexity with respect to the change of the temporal structure. With the numerical analyses, we show that the PTE can give the information that other methods, like the permutation entropy (PE), cannot. We apply the PTE method to the financial time series analysis, which reveals the existence of the momentum effect in the daily closing price and the daily trading volume of Chinese stock markets. It indicates that the dynamical complexity of these two indexes in stock markets is lower than that of the random time series. While the logarithm return and the logarithm change of trading volume show very similar PTE values with those of the random time series, which represents higher randomness.},

  abstract       = {When considering the transition probability matrix of ordinal patterns, transition permutation entropy (TPE) can effectively extract fault features by quantifying the irregularity and complexity of signals. However, TPE can only characterize the complexity of the vibration signals at a single scale. Therefore, a multiscale transition permutation entropy (MTPE) technique has been proposed. However, the original multiscale method still has some inherent defects in the coarse-grained process, such as considerably shortening the length of time series at large scale, which leads to a low entropy evaluation accuracy. In order to solve these problems, a composite multiscale transition permutation entropy (CMTPE) method was proposed in order to improve the incomplete coarse-grained analysis of MTPE by avoiding the loss of some key information in the original fault signals, and to improve the performance of feature extraction, robustness to noise, and accuracy of entropy estimation. A fault diagnosis strategy based on CMTPE and an extreme learning machine (ELM) was proposed. Both simulation and experimental signals verified the advantages of the proposed CMTPE method. The results show that, compared with other comparison strategies, this strategy has better robustness, and can carry out feature recognition and bearing fault diagnosis more accurately and with improved stability.},
