\title{New Features of Permutation Entropy in Ordinal Patterns Complexity Plane}
%%% ACF Correct the title

\abstract{Time series analysis plays a vital role in understanding the underlying dynamics of complex systems across various domains such as engineering, economics, and the physical sciences. Traditional approaches, namely time-domain and frequency-domain methods often rely on strong assumptions such as stationarity, large sample sizes, or normality, which are frequently violated in real-world data. As a robust alternative, Bandt and Pompe~\cite{PhysRevLett.88.174102} introduced a non-parametric method based on ordinal pattern symbolization and information theoretic descriptors. This approach transforms local segments of the time series into rank-based symbols, constructs a histogram of ordinal patterns, and computes permutation entropy, offering resistance to noise and model independence. 
%%% ACF 1- symbolisation, 2- histogram, 3- descriptors (H and C)	
Building on this, Lamberti et al~\cite{lamberti2004intensive} introduced statistical complexity, allowing the joint representation of entropy and complexity in the entropy-complexity plane. 
This proposal investigates the use of permutation entropy and statistical complexity for time series analysis, focusing on pattern histogram 
%%% ACF What do we do with respect to histogram construction?
construction, descriptor estimation, and confidence interval evaluation. The goal is to assess the statistical properties and practical utility of these measures for analyzing nonlinear, noisy, and nonstationary time series data.}
