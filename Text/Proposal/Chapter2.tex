More about the methodology 

In this concept first, the time series data is convert into order patterns and then calculate the sequence of probabilities from the patterns. Third, estimate the normalized Shannon entropy from the probability sequence.  After that ordinal patterns complexity plane is use as a visual representation of the relationship between permutation entropy and the complexity measures. 



The outline of this proposal is as follows: After the introduction, in 
Chapter~\ref{C:lit} 
we have literature review, followed by more explanation of the details of this project in Chapter 3. Finally, we describe future plans for this project in Chapter 4.
