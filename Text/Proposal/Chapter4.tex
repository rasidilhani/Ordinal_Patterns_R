\chapter{Future Works}\label{C:futw}

As a short summary, we have completed the necessary preliminaries studies on various topics such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entropy
    \item Complexity
    \item Entropy Complexity Plane
    \item Confidence interval
    %\item Multinomial modal.
\end{itemize}

We have also examined key research articles by Bandt and Pompe \cite{PhysRevLett.88.174102}, along with an overview of the area focusing on four seminal works. These include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item López-Ruiz et al. \cite{lopez1995statistical}, who introduced the concept of statistical complexity;
	\item Lamberti et al. \cite{lamberti2004intensive}, who applied López-Ruiz's idea using the Euclidean distance;
	\item Rosso et al. \cite{EEGAnalysisUsingWaveletBasedInformationTools}, who proposed the entropy-complexity plane as a diagnostic tool; and
	\item Martin et al. \cite{Martin2006}, who defined the theoretical boundaries of this generalized statistical complexity measure.
\end{itemize}

In addition, we reviewed recent work by Rey et al. \cite{Rey2025,Rey2023a,Rey2023}, which investigates the statistical properties of entropy derived from ordinal patterns, including the asymptotic distribution under the multinomial law and the behavior of permutation entropy.

This proposal has three objectives in order to continue this research work.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define a data base of time series for clustering, i.e., finding similar time series. 
	\item Extract all the features we know from their Bandt \& Pompe symbolization (Shannon, Tsallis and Renyi entropies, Fisher information measure, complexities, and the available confidence intervals)
	\item Use those features for time series clustering 
\end{itemize}
