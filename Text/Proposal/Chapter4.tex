\chapter{Future Works}\label{C:futw}

As a short summary, we have completed the necessary preliminaries studies on various topics such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
    \item mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
    \item mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
\end{itemize}

and also we have examined the relevant research articles by Bandt \& Pompe \cite{PhysRevLett.88.174102}, Rey et.al \cite{Rey2023a,Rey2023}.


This proposal has three objectives in order to continue this research work.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define a data base of time series for clustering, i.e., finding similar time series. 
	\item Extract all the features we know from their Bandt \& Pompe symbolization (Shannon, Tsallis and Renyi entropies, Fisher information measure, complexities, and the available confidence intervals)
	\item Use those features for time series clustering 
\end{itemize}
