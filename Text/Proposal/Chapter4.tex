\chapter{Future Works}\label{C:futw}

As a short summary, we have completed the necessary preliminaries studies on various topics such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Entropy
    \item Complexity
    \item Entropy Complexity Plane
    \item Confidence interval
    \item Multinomial distribution.
\end{itemize}

Also we have examined the relevant research articles by Bandt \& Pompe \cite{PhysRevLett.88.174102}, and statistical properties of the entropy from ordinal patterns, asymptotic distribution of certain types of entropy under the Multinomial law, and the asymptotic distribution of the permutation entropy studied by Rey et.al \cite{Rey2025,Rey2023a,Rey2023}.

This proposal has three objectives in order to continue this research work.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define a data base of time series for clustering, i.e., finding similar time series. 
	\item Extract all the features we know from their Bandt \& Pompe symbolization (Shannon, Tsallis and Renyi entropies, Fisher information measure, complexities, and the available confidence intervals)
	\item Use those features for time series clustering 
\end{itemize}
