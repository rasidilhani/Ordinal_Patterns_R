  This research aims to identify perturbations in machines using time series data, where detecting chaotic patterns is notably challenging. Bandt and Pompe proposed looking at time series from the perspective of ordinal patterns to develop fast and automated methods for extracting qualitative information from nonlinear time series. They developed the idea of permutation entropy to measure the complexity of a system underlying a time series, taking into account the ordinal patterns that represent the variations in a time series. Only one aspect of the ordinal structure of a time series is revealed by the permutation entropy. Here we show how to use the real-valued data set to extract all ordinal information.

# Introduction {#sec1}

Bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, yet their demanding operating conditions, which involve high loads and impacts, often lead to various faults. These faults can cause significant downtime, costly maintenance, and even complete machine failure. Therefore, early and accurate detection and classification of bearing faults are essential to ensure operational reliability and minimize maintenance costs.

Traditional fault detection methods primarily rely on analyzing physical parameters and trends using techniques such as vibration analysis, thermal monitoring, and current signature analysis. While these methods have proven effective, they can be susceptible to noise and often require substantial computational resources. Ordinal pattern analysis has emerged as a promising alternative, offering a robust and computationally efficient approach to analyzing time series data.

At its core, ordinal pattern analysis transforms continuous time series data into a sequence of ordinal patterns that represent the order relationships among data points within a specified time window. This approach effectively captures the fundamental dynamics of the signal in a way that is inherently robust to noise and distortions. By analyzing these patterns, it becomes possible to identify subtle changes in system behavior that may indicate the presence of a fault.

This study investigates the application of ordinal pattern analysis for the early detection and classification of bearing faults, focusing on common fault types such as ball defects, outer race defects, and inner race defects. Using a publicly available dataset from the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ordinal patterns in distinguishing between healthy and faulty bearing conditions.

Our research explores the advantages of ordinal pattern analysis in detecting changes in system dynamics associated with faults. By identifying alterations in the frequency and recurrence of specific temporal patterns, this technique can reveal subtle indicators of developing faults. Furthermore, unlike some traditional methods limited to linear systems, ordinal pattern analysis can effectively detect faults in complex, non-linear systems, broadening its applicability.

While traditional methods often rely on specialized sensors and data acquisition systems, ordinal pattern analysis has the potential to achieve comparable results using simpler time series data, underscoring its potential for broader adoption. We investigate the sensitivity of ordinal pattern analysis to subtle changes in system dynamics, particularly in complex systems, where its strengths may be most pronounced.

Our goal is to establish ordinal pattern analysis as a viable and advantageous tool for bearing fault diagnosis, contributing to advancements in predictive maintenance technologies and promoting more efficient and reliable operation of rotating machinery.

## Permutation Entropy
Permutation entropy is a widely used feature for quantifying the complexity and randomness of time series data. It can also be described as a measure of a signal's proximity to white noise. This concept was introduced by Christoph Bandt and Bernd Pompe in 2002 [@PhysRevLett.88.174102]. The primary goal of developing this method was to create a robust and invariant approach for analyzing complex signals across various fields, including finance, social systems, climate science, physics, physiology, and neuroscience.

The complexity measure is computed from the probabilities of ordinal patterns and has been applied to tasks such as analyzing bearing fault recordings at different machine speeds. The convergence behavior of the asymptotic variance of permutation entropy to its limit distribution was studied by [@REY2024115481]. These findings enable tests for comparing the underlying dynamics of two time series. We apply these tests to distinguish uniform white noise in bearing fault data.

A key advantage of this approach is its ability to plot a point with coordinates of entropy and statistical complexity within a closed manifold. The position of this point reveals structural information about the underlying dynamics that generated the time series data, as we introduced.

For notational simplicity, we consider a real-valued time series of length $N=n+D-1; D\ge2$ is an integer known as the embedding dimension. We denote this time series as **$x$** $= (x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n+D-1})$. For $t=1, 2, …,n,$ let $s_t = (x_t,x_{t+1},…,x_{t+D-1})$ represent an overlapping window of $D$ consecutive values in $x$. Assume that each of these values is distinct. Then, map each subsequence $s_t$ to a symbol $\pi_t$ uniquely determined by the indexes that sort $(x_t, x_{t+1}, ..., x_{t+D-1})$; this is the ordinal pattern of $s_t$. This process, known as "Bandt–Pompe Symbolization" or "Ordinal Pattern Transformation," converts the time series **$x$** into a sequence of symbols $\pi=(\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n)$. Each symbol $\pi_j$ can take one of $D!$ possible values: $\pi_j \in \Pi=\{\pi^{(1)}, \pi^{(2)}, ..., \pi^{(D!)}\}$. The probability that the pattern $\pi^{(i)}$ appears in the sequence **$\pi$** is denoted by $q_i,$ for $i=1,2, ..., D!$.

The sequence of patterns is invariant to monotonically increasing transformations of **$x$** and is less sensitive to outliers than descriptors that rely on the original values [@chagas2022white]. These two properties make ordinal patterns effective for signal analysis and interpretation [@amigo2023ordinal]. Ordinal patterns are computed by constructing a histogram of the proportions of symbols in **$\pi$**.

Let $p=(p_1 ,p_2 ,... p_k)$ be a probability vector of size $k$. The Shannon entropy based on the $p$ vector is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
S^{(s)}[p]=-\sum_{i=1}^{k}{p_i \log p_i}
\end{equation}


## Ordinal Patterns
In this section, we provide a brief overview of the methodology based on ordinal patterns proposed by Bandt and Pompe [@PhysRevLett.88.174102]. We use a real-valued time series, represented by the vector $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n+D-1})$, where $n$ and $D\ge 2$ are positive integers, to illustrate the concept. 

Consider an overlapping window $s_t=(x_t, x_{t+1}, ..., x_{t+D-1})$ of $D$ consecutive, distinct values in $x$. Let $\Pi=\{\pi^{(1)}, \pi^{(2)}, ..., \pi^{(D!)}\}$ represent the set of labeled permutations, or symbols, of the indices $0,1,...,D-1$, corresponding to the possible ordinal patterns defined as follows: Given $t \in \{1,2,...,n\},$ the subsequence $s_t$ is of type $\pi^{(i)}=(i_1, i_2, ..., i_D),$ if $x_{t+i_1}\le x_{t+i_2} \le ...\le x_{t+i_D}.$  In cases of tied data, order is determined by the sequential appearance of repeated values. For example, when $D=3,$ the subsequence $s_t=(4,2,4)$ is of type $(1,0,2)$. Thus, from the time series $x,$ we obtain a sequence of symbols or ordinal patterns $\pi=(\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n),$ where $\pi_j \in \Pi$ for $j=1,2,...,n.$

The underlying dynamics of the time series determine the ordinal pattern probability vector, represented as  $V = (q_1,q_2, ..., q_{D!}),$ where $q_i,$ indicates the relative frequency of the pattern $\pi^{(i)}$ in the sequence of ordinal patterns, for $i=1,2,...,D!.$ 

This calculation operates by examining neighboring values within a predefined embedding dimension $D,$ assigning them to a corresponding ordinal pattern. The number of possible patterns depends on the embedding dimension $D$, with $|\pi_D|=D!$, where $\pi_D$, contains all possible ordinal patterns. For example, if $D=3$ then $|\pi_3|=3!=6,$ corresponding to the patterns $\{123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321\}$ as illustrated in \@ref(fig:fig_1).

# Methodology {#Methodology}

The data were obtained from the Bearing Data Center and the seeded fault test data at the Case Western Reserve University, School of Engineering. The dataset includes ball bearing test data for normal bearings, as well as single-point defects on the drive end and fan end. Data were collected at rates of 12,000 and 48,000 data points per second for the drive-end bearing tests, and at 12,000 data points per second for the fan-end bearing tests. Each file includes motor rotational speed, drive-end vibration data, and fan-end vibration data. The variable names in each file indicate the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DE - drive end accelerometer data
  \item FE - fan end accelerometer data
  \item BA - base accelerometer data
  \item time - time series data
  \item RPM - rpm during testing 
\end{itemize}


For ease of use, the data were categorized as Normal Baseline Data, 12k Drive End Bearing Fault Data, 48k Drive End Bearing Fault Data, and Fan End Bearing Fault Data. The normal baseline data include four motor load levels: 0, 1, 2, and 3, with approximate motor speeds provided in RPM (1797, 1772, 1750, and 1730). The 12k Drive End, 48k Drive End, and 12k Fan End bearing data follow the same motor load levels and speeds. This research aims to identify faulty machines using the separate time series data.

This study explores the use of ordinal pattern analysis for the early detection and classification of bearing faults, focusing on common fault types such as ball, outer race, and inner race defects. Using a publicly available dataset from the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ordinal patterns in distinguishing between healthy and faulty bearing conditions.

This research aims to identify faulty machines. Each data file consists of two time series, which we examine using ordinal patterns. We introduce distance as a measure of similarity between segments based on their ordinal structure. With specific embedding dimensions, this metric can be used to distinguish faulty machines. We apply permutation entropy for rolling bearing fault diagnosis and show that embedding dimensions from 3 to 6 effectively separate faulty machines. Some machines exhibit white noise, which lies near the lower and upper boundaries. The complexity plane is used to analyze the results, confirming that dimension 5 yields the best outcomes.  

Examples of time series data are shown as follows.

Figure 2 shows the DE, FE and BA time series for engine loads 0, 1, 2 and 3. From these time series it is not possible to identify the faulty machines. However, Figures 3 and 4 show the normal baseline DE time series for a motor load of 0 and the accelerometer time series data at the 12,000 fan end for a motor load of 0. The graph is clear and it can be seen that it is failure time series data is about time series. However, it is difficult to separate the exact machine type and other characteristics of the data. The main idea of this research work is to identify perturbation machines using the various time series data given above. First, time series data were analyzed and then the method described by @REY2024115481 used the StatOrdPatt package to analyze the data. Next, the probability distribution of the ordinal pattern was considered and the entropy permutation entropy was calculated accordingly. Based on the entropy of each time series data, the entropy complexity level was considered to distinguish the faulty machines.


# Results {#Results}

Permutation entropy guarantees the separation of error machines. With this experimental result, we can see that the embedding dimensions from 3 to 6 result in separate error machines. We see that the machines form clusters, but also that they have individual signatures. The following graphic shows the lower and upper bounds of the points in entropy complexity level for embedding dimensions between 3 and 6 for engine load 0,1,2 and 3. The points of the time series in the $H×C$ plane as well as the confidence intervals for their Shannon entropies are taken into account.
