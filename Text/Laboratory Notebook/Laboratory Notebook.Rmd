  The purpose of this research is to identify perturbation machines from the time series data. Chaos are hard to detect from time series. Bandt and Pompe proposed looking at time series from the perspective of ordinal patterns to develop fast and automated methods for extracting qualitative information from nonlinear time series. They developed the idea of permutation entropy to measure the complexity of a system underlying a time series, taking into account the ordinal patterns that represent the variations in a time series. Only one aspect of the ordinal structure of a time series is revealed by the permutation entropy. Here we show how to use the real-valued data set to extract all ordinal information.

# Introduction {#sec1}

Bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, yet their demanding operating conditions involving high loads and impacts often lead to various faults. These faults can result in significant downtime, costly maintenance, and even complete machine failure. Therefore, early and accurate detection and classification of bearing faults are essential for ensuring operational reliability and minimizing maintenance expenses.

Traditional fault detection methods primarily rely on analyzing physical parameters and trends using techniques such as vibration analysis, thermal monitoring, and current signature analysis. While these methods have proven effective, they can be susceptible to noise and often require substantial computational resources. Ordinal pattern analysis has emerged as a promising alternative, offering a robust and computationally efficient approach for analyzing time series data.

At its core, ordinal pattern analysis involves transforming continuous time series data into a sequence of ordinal patterns that represent the order relationships among data points within a given time window. This approach effectively captures the fundamental dynamics of the signal in a manner that is inherently robust to noise and distortions. By analyzing these patterns, it becomes possible to identify subtle changes in system behavior that may indicate the presence of a fault.

This study investigates the application of ordinal pattern analysis for early detection and classification of bearing faults, focusing on common fault types such as ball, outer race, and inner race defects. Using a publicly available dataset from the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of ordinal patterns in distinguishing between healthy and faulty bearing conditions.

Our research will explore the advantages of ordinal pattern analysis in detecting changes in system dynamics associated with faults. By identifying alterations in the frequency and recurrence of specific temporal patterns, this technique can reveal subtle indicators of developing faults. Furthermore, unlike some traditional methods limited to linear systems, ordinal pattern analysis can effectively detect faults in complex, non-linear systems, broadening its applicability.

Traditional methods often rely on specialized sensors and data acquisition systems, ordinal pattern analysis can potentially achieve comparable results using simpler time series data, highlighting its potential for wider adoption. We will investigate the sensitivity of ordinal pattern analysis to subtle changes in system dynamics, particularly within complex systems, where its strengths may be most pronounced.

We aim to establish ordinal pattern analysis as a viable and advantageous tool for bearing fault diagnosis, contributing to the advancement of predictive maintenance technologies and promoting more efficient and reliable operation of rotating machinery.

## Permutation Entropy
Permutation entropy is an important feature widely used by researchers to quantify the complexity and randomness of time series data. It can also be described as a measure of a signal's proximity to white noise. This concept was introduced by Christoph Bandt and Bernd Pompe in 2002 [@PhysRevLett.88.174102]. The primary goal of developing this method is to create a more robust and invariant approach to analyzing complex signals across various fields, including finance, social systems, climate, physics, physiology, and neuroscience. The complexity measure is computed from the probabilities of ordinal patterns and has been proposed for applications such as the analysis of bearing fault recordings at different machine speeds. The convergence behavior of the asymptotic variance for the permutation entropy to the limit distribution has been studied by [@REY2024115481]. These results lead to tests for comparing the underlying dynamics of two time series. We apply this tests to discriminate uniform white noise for the bearing fault data. One of the greatest appeals of this approach is the ability to display the point with coordinates entropy and statistical complexity in a closed manifold. The point position reveals structural information about the underlying dynamics that produced the time series data as we introduced.

For the sake of notational simplicity, we consider the real-valued time series of length $N=n+D-1; D\ge2$ is an integer called the embedding dimension. Denote this time series as **{$x$}** $= (x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n+D-1})$. For $t=1, 2, …,n,$ let $s_t = (x_t,x_{t+1},…,x_{t+D-1})$ be an overlapping window of $D$ consecutive values in $x$. Assume these values are different. Then, map each subsequence $s_t$ into a symbol $\pi_t$ univocally determined by the indexes that sort $(x_t, x_{t+1}, ..., x_{t+D-1})$; this is the ordinal pattern of $s_t$. This operation, called ‘‘Bandt–Pompe Symbolization’’ or ‘‘Ordinal Pattern Transformation’’, converts the time series **$x$** into the sequence of symbols $\pi=(\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n)$. Each symbol $\pi_j$ can take one of $D!$ values: $\pi_j \in \Pi=\{\pi^{(1)}, \pi^{(2)}, ..., \pi^{(D!)}\}$. The probability that the pattern $\pi^{(i)}$ appears in the sequence **$\pi$** is denoted by $q_i,$ for $i=1,2, ..., D!$.

The sequence of patterns is invariant to monotonically increasing functions of **$x$** and it is less sensitive to outliers than descriptors that use the original values [@chagas2022white]. These two features make the ordinal patterns efficient for signal analysis and interpretation [@amigo2023ordinal]. The ordinal patterns are based on computing the histogram of proportion of symbols in **$\pi$**.

Let $p=(p_1 ,p_2 ,... p_k)$ be a probability vector of size $k$, the Shannon entropy based on the $p$ vector is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
S^{(s)}[p]=-\sum_{i=1}^{k}{p_i \log p_i}
\end{equation}


## Ordinal Patterns
In this section, we provide a brief overview of the methodology based on ordinal patterns proposed by Bandt and Pompe [@PhysRevLett.88.174102]. A real-valued time series, represented by the vector $x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n+D-1})$, where $n$ and $D\ge 2$ are positive integers is employed to elucidate the concept. Let us consider the case where $s_t=(x_t, x_{t+1}, ..., x_{t+D-1})$ represent an overlapping window of $m$ consecutive different values in $x$. We consider $\Pi=\{\pi^{(1)}, \pi^{(2)}, ..., \pi^{(D!)}\}$ which represents the set of labeled permutations, or symbols, of the elements $0,1,...,m-1$, corresponding to the possible ordinal patterns defined as follows. Given $t \in \{1,2,...,n\},$ the subsequence $s_t$ is said to be of type $\pi^{(i)}$ where $\pi^{(i)}=(i_1, i_2, ..., i_D),$ if $x_{t+i_1}\le x_{t+i_2} \le ...\le x_{t+i_D}.$ In the case of tied data, the order is determined by the sequential appearance of the repeated values. For example, for$D=3,$ the subsequence $s_t=(4,2,4)$ is type $(1,0,2)$. Thus, from the time series $x,$ we obtain a sequence of symbols, or ordinal patterns, $\pi=(\pi_1, \pi_2, ..., \pi_n),$ where $\pi_j \in \Pi$ for $j=1,2,...,n.$

The underlying dynamics of the time series determine the ordinal pattern probability vector, represented as $V = (q_1,q_2, ..., q_{D!}).$ In this instance, for $i=1,...,D$, $q_i$ indicates the relative frequency of $\pi_i$ in the series of ordinal patterns. 

The calculation operates by neighboring values within a pre-defined embedding dimension $D$ by position value, assigning them to a corresponding ordinal pattern. The number of possible patterns depends on the embedding dimension $D$, with $|\pi_D|=D!$, where $\pi_D$, as the labeling set, contains all these possible ordinal patterns. The indices starting from 1 to $D$. The possible ordinal patterns result from the defined embedding dimension, example, for $D=3$ are $|\pi_3|=3!=6, \{123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321\}.$ Hence the possible patterns are those shown in \ref fig1.

# Methodology {#Methodology}

The data are considered from the Bearing data centre and seeded fault test data at the Case Western Reserve University, School of Engineering. The data set consists of ball bearing test data for normal bearings, single-point drive end, and fan end defects. A total of 12,000 and 48,000 data points were considered per second for the drive-end bearing tests. Fan end bearing was also obtained at a rate of 12,000 data points per second. Each file includes motor rotational speed, drive end vibration data, and fan data. For all files, the following item in the variable name indicates:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DE - drive end accelerometer data
  \item FE - fan end accelerometer data
  \item BA - base accelerometer data
  \item time - time series data
  \item RPM - rpm during testing 
\end{itemize}


Further, for the easiness of use data were separated by the name Normal Baseline Data, 12k Drive End Bearing Fault Data, 48k Drive End Bearing Fault Data, and Fan-End Bearing Fault Data. Normal baseline data has four motor loads 0, 1, 2, and 3. Approximate motor speed was given in rpm. (1797, 1772, 1750, 1730). 12k Drive End, 48k Drive End and 12k Fan End bearing data follow the same motor loads and speeds. The research is conducted to identify the fault machines from the separate time series data. 

Bearings are critical components in rotating machinery, yet their demanding operating conditions involving high loads and impacts often lead to various faults. These faults can result in significant downtime, costly maintenance, and even complete machine failure. Therefore, early and accurate detection and classification of bearing faults are essential for ensuring operational reliability and minimizing maintenance expenses. Traditional fault detection methods primarily rely on analyzing physical parameters and trends using vibration analysis, thermal monitoring, and current signature analysis techniques. While these methods have proven effective, they can be susceptible to noise and often require substantial computational resources. Ordinal pattern analysis has emerged as a promising alternative, offering a robust and computationally efficient approach for analyzing time series data. At its core, ordinal pattern analysis involves transforming continuous time series data into a sequence of ordinal patterns that represent the order relationships among data points within a given time window. This approach effectively captures the fundamental dynamics of the signal in a manner that is inherently robust to noise and distortions. By analyzing these patterns, it becomes possible to identify subtle changes in system behavior that may indicate the presence of a fault. This study investigates the application of ordinal pattern analysis for early detection and classification of bearing faults, focusing on common fault types such as ball, outer race, and inner race defects. Using a publicly available dataset from the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of ordinal patterns in distinguishing between healthy and faulty bearing conditions. The data set consist of ball bearing test data for normal bearings, single-point drive end and fan end defects. A total of 12,000 and 48,000 data points were considered per second for the drive end bearing tests. Fan end bearing was also obtained at a rate of 12,000 data points per second. Each file includes motor rotational speed, drive end vibration data, and fan data. Further, for the easiness of use data were separated by the name Normal Baseline Data, 12k Drive End Bearing Fault Data, 48k Drive End Bearing Fault Data, Fan-End Bearing Fault Data. Normal baseline data has four motor loads 0, 1, 2, and 3. Approximate motor speed was given in rpm. (1797, 1772, 1750, 1730). 12k Drive End, 48k Drive End and 12k Fan End bearing data follows the same motor loads and speeds. The research is conducted to identify the fault machines. Each data file consists of two time series and we examined two time series data using ordinal patterns. We introduce distance as a measure of similarity between segments based on the ordinal structure. With specific embedding dimensions, it can be employed to distinguish fault machines. We show an application of Permutation entropy on rolling bearing fault diagnosis. The results of this experiment shows that dimension 3 and 4 results separate fault machines. Some machines recognize with white noise which is close to the lower and upper boundary. The complexity plane is used to analyse the results and it has confirmed that dimension 4 is assured the best results.  

Examples of time series data are shown as follows.

Figure 2 shows the DE, FE and BA time series for engine loads 0, 1, 2 and 3. Looking at these time series it is not possible to identify the faulty machines. However, the Figure 3 and 4 shows the normal baseline DE time series for a motor load of 0 and the accelerometer time series data at the 12,000 fan end for a motor load of 0. The graph is clear and it is noticeable that fault time series data consists of time series. However, it is difficult to separate the exact machine type and other characteristics of the data. The main idea of this research work is to identify fault machines from the various time series data given above. First, time series data was analyzed and then the StatOrdPatt package introduced by @REY2024115481 was used to analyze the data. Next, the probability distribution of the ordinal pattern was considered and the entropy permutation entropy was calculated accordingly. Based on the entropy of each time series data, the entropy complexity level was considered to separate the faulty machines.

# Results {#Results}

The permutation entropy guarantees to separate fault machines. With this experimental result, we can see that dimensions 3 and 4 result in separate fault machines. We see that the machines form clusters, but also that they have individual signatures. The below table shows the Shannon entropy and the complexity results for embedding dimensions 3 and 4.
