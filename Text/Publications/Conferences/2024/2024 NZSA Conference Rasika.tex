\section{Introduction}

Ordinal Patterns are transformations that encode the sorting characteristics of values in $\mathbbm R^D$ into $D!$ symbols.

They were proposed by Bandt \& Pompe in 2002, and have proven their adequacy at extracting valuable information about the system that produces the data.

One of the possible encodings is associated to the set of indexes that sort the $D$ values in non-decreasing order, for example:
$$
(4.2, 5.1, 7.1, 3.9, 8.6) \longmapsto (2, 3, 4, 1, 5) \longmapsto \beth \text{ (one of }5!=120 \text{ symbols)}.
$$
A time series $\bm x = (x_1,x_2,\dots,x_{D+n-1})$ can be transformed into a sequence of symbols $\bm \pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\dots,\pi_n)$ where $\pi_i=\pi_i(x_i,x_{i+1},\dots, x_{i+D-1})$; $D$ is called the ``embedding dimension,'' and usually ranges between $3$ and $6$.
Then, we compute $\bm h =(h_1,h_2,\dots,h_{D!})$ the histogram of $\bm \pi$, and from its two descriptors:
A measure of the system's disorder is the first descriptor. The Shannon entropy, which is defined as follows, is the most commonly used feature for this.
\begin{equation}
    H[p]=-\sum_{i=1}^{D!}{p_i \log p_i}
\end{equation}
with the convention that terms in the summation for which $p_i=0$ are null. This quantity is bounded in the unit interval. It is zero when $p_i=1$ for some $i$ (and, thus, all other bins are zero), and one when $p_i=1/D!$ for every $i$ (the uniform probability function). 

In Shannon entropy, complexity can be inferred from the level of unpredictability in the system. In permutation entropy, complexity measures capture patterns in ordinal sequences. Other measure statistical complexity refine this by combining entropy and additional features of the system’s structure.

In the context of entropy, complexity $C$ is often related to the balance between randomness and structure in a system. It reflects the degree of order, disorder, and unpredictability in a dataset or time series. Moreover, $C$ is capable of discerning between different degrees of periodicity, among other relevant properties.

An arbitrary time series analyzed with embedding dimension $D$ and mapped on histograms of $D!$$ \text{ bins can produce any set of points }  $$(H, C)$$ \text{ that make up the entropy–complexity plane. We take infinitely long series into consideration, and the time delay is irrelevant.}
Example of the edges of the $H$ \times $C$ plane is displayed below.

\section{Data}\label{section1}
The data were obtained from the Bearing Data Center and the seeded fault test data at the Case Western Reserve University, School of Engineering. 
The dataset includes ball bearing test data for normal bearings, as well as single-point defects on the drive end and fan end. 
Data were collected at rates of 12,000 and 48,000 data points per second for the drive-end bearing tests and at 12,000 data points per second for the fan-end
bearing tests. Each file includes motor rotational speed, drive-end vibration data, and fan-end vibration data. The variable names in each file
indicate the following:
\begin{itemize}
        \item DE - drive end accelerometer data
        \item FE - fan end accelerometer data
	\item BA - base accelerometer data
	\item time - time series data
	\item RPM - rpm during testing
\end{itemize}
	
For ease of use, the data were categorized as Normal Baseline Data, 12k Drive End Bearing Fault Data, 48k Drive End Bearing Fault Data, and Fan
End Bearing Fault Data. The normal baseline data include four motor load levels: 0, 1, 2, and 3, with approximate motor speeds provided in RPM
(1797, 1772, 1750, and 1730). The 12k Drive End, 48k Drive End, and 12k Fan End bearing data follow the same motor load levels and speeds. This
research aims to identify faulty machines using the time series of their measured features.
Examples of normal baseline and 48k drive end time series data are shown as follows.

\section{Methodology}\label{section2}

With an emphasis on common fault types like ball, outer race, and inner race defects, this study investigates the application of ordinal pattern analysis for the early detection and classification of bearing faults. The goal of this study is to locate malfunctioning machinery. We use ordinal patterns to analyze the two time series in each data file. Based on the ordinal structure of the segments, we introduce distance as a metric of similarity. This metric can be used to identify malfunctioning machines with certain embedding dimensions. We demonstrate that embedding dimensions ranging from 3 to 6 effectively separate defective machines by using permutation entropy for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. The results of embedding dimension 4 with normal base line and 48k drive end time series data are presented in this article. White noise is found close to the upper and lower limits. With the graph below, it is evident. The results are analyzed using the complexity plane, which confirms that dimension 4 produces the best results to date. Time series data were first examined, and the StatOrdPatt package was then used to analyze the data using the methodology outlined by Rey et al. (2024). The entropy permutation entropy was then computed taking into account the ordinal pattern's probability distribution. To identify the malfunctioning machines, the entropy complexity level was taken into consideration based on the entropy of each time series data set.

\section{Results}\label{section3}
The embedding dimension 4 results for normal base line and 48k drive are considered to set up this analysis. Figure 4 shows the DE, and FE time series for engine loads 0, 1, 2 and 3. The graph is clear and it can be seen that it is failure time series data is about time series. However, it is difficult to separate the exact machine type and other characteristics of the data. The main idea of this research work is to identify perturbation machines using the various time series data given above. 
Examples of normal base line and 48k drive end time series data are shown as follows.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

Permutation entropy guarantees the separation of error machines. With this experimental result, we can see that the embedding dimension 4 result in separate error machines. We see that the machines form clusters, but also that they have individual signatures. The points of the time series in the $H$ \times $C$ plane as well as the confidence intervals for their Shannon entropies are taken into account.

This research will be extended to further analyze results for embedding dimensions ranging from 3 to 6. Additionally, the remaining dataset will be utilized for more comprehensive analysis. Future work will also focus on studying feature selection techniques based on cluster and variability analyses, specifically for ordinal multi-class classification problems, to provide deeper insights and elaborate the findings.
