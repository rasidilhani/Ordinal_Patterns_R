The goal of StatOrdPattHxC is to provide high-level functions for computing the following quantities:

* Under the multinomial model:
    * The asymptotic normal variance of several types of entropy (Shannon, RÃ©nyi, Tsallis) and of the Fisher information measure
    * The asymptotic normal mean and variance of the Statistical Complexity
 
* For Bandt & Pompe symbols:
    * The symbolisation operation that transforms a time series realisation into a sequence of symbols
    * The asymptotic normal mean and variance of the entropy of these symbols
    * A test that assesses if two time series realisations have the same entropy
