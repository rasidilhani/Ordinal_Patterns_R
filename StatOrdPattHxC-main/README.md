# Package StatOrdPattHxC
This package computes the asymptotic variance of the Shannon, RÃ©nyi and Tsallis entropies, and of the Fisher information measure. Given two time series, this asymptotic variances allows to perform a test with the null hypothesis that the observations were produced by the same dynamics
