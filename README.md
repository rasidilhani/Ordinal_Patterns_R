## Ordinal Patterns in the complexity plance
The main focus of this research is to parallel the work of Bandt and Pompe. The research outputs are organized as follows:

Select the famous dataset.
Obtain the pattern frequencies.
Calculate the probabilities.
Compute the permutation Shannon entropy and Jensen-Shannon entropy.
Plot the frequency histogram.
Obtain results from different embedding systems.
Generate the complexity plane.
Plot the complexity plane against the probabilities
